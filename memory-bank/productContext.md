## Why GrantGPT Exists

GrantGPT is a specialized fork of the Onyx/Danswer RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Its primary purpose is to provide an AI Assistant and unified search capabilities tailored specifically for the grant application and management domain. While Onyx/Danswer offers a general-purpose knowledge management solution, GrantGPT aims to address the unique challenges faced by individuals and organizations involved in securing and managing grants.

## Problems GrantGPT Solves

1.  **Information Overload in Grant Research:** Grant seekers often face a vast amount of information across various sources (grant guidelines, past applications, research papers, legal documents). GrantGPT aims to centralize and make this information easily searchable and digestible.
2.  **Inefficient Grant Application Drafting:** Drafting grant applications requires synthesizing information from multiple documents and adhering to specific guidelines. GrantGPT can assist by providing quick answers, relevant document excerpts, and potentially even drafting support based on the ingested knowledge.
3.  **Lack of Centralized Knowledge for Grant Management:** Organizations managing multiple grants need a unified view of their historical data, reporting requirements, and compliance information. GrantGPT provides a centralized knowledge base for this.
4.  **Difficulty in Tracking Grant-Related Communications:** Communications related to grants (emails, meeting notes, internal discussions) are often scattered. GrantGPT can integrate with communication tools to provide a comprehensive view.

## How GrantGPT Should Work

GrantGPT should function as an intelligent assistant that:
*   **Ingests Diverse Grant-Related Data:** Connects to various data sources relevant to grants (e.g., internal documents, public grant databases, research papers, communication platforms).
*   **Provides Accurate AI Answers:** Leverages LLMs to provide precise, context-aware answers to user queries based on the ingested data.
*   **Offers Unified Search:** Allows users to search across all connected grant-related data sources from a single interface.
*   **Supports Chat Interface:** Provides a natural language chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant.
*   **Maintains Data Security and Access Control:** Ensures sensitive grant information is protected and accessible only to authorized users.
*   **Integrates Seamlessly:** Offers integrations with common workplace tools and potentially grant-specific platforms.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive and User-Friendly:** The interface should be easy to navigate for both technical and non-technical users.
*   **Fast and Responsive:** Queries should be processed quickly, and the UI should feel snappy.
*   **Reliable and Trustworthy:** Users should have confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
*   **Secure and Private:** Users should feel assured that their sensitive grant data is protected.
*   **Empowering:** GrantGPT should empower users to find information faster, draft applications more efficiently, and manage grants more effectively, ultimately increasing their success rate.
